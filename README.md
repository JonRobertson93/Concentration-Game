# Game of Concentration
This game is a simple matching game where the user flips over 2 cards at a time to try and finds matches in as few turns as possible. <br/>
If the cards match, they stay flipped up. If the cards do not match they both are flipped back over, the user's turn counter is increased and they will start their next turn.  <br/> If the user finds all matches before they run out of turns, they win! If not, they lose all 3 stars and will lose the game.
